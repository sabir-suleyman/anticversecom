    <h1 class="anim-slide-right-appear">The Story of Orpheus Underland</h1>
    <p class="anim-appear">It all begins with a decision made in an unpredictable future age, at the highest stages of human technological evolution. In an era where the necessity of evolving human beings into the next level of superhumanity is embraced along with the idea of atheism, groundbreaking work is carried out.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">The people of the future age seek answers to all questions right from the first moment of vitality, categorizing the development resulting from all genetic circulation with evolution, and researching the spatial and temporal paradigms of the organism that most embraces change.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">Based on Darwin's quote "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent... It is the one that is most adaptable to change that survives!", the people of the future age examine the examples of superhuman species in human history and argue that almost all of these examples disappeared because they could not keep up with change.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">In the future age, people cannot find any reference or example of the genetic sequence of the superhuman species. However, they believed that such examples existed in history. Especially those known as prophets; individuals who were believed to be appointed by God and aimed to convey God's messages, were thought to be an example of the superhuman phenomenon in history. However, for the people of the future age, most of history was considered lost, especially because most of the data from history had been lost due to major crises. According to the analysis, it was thought that the last prophet was Jesus and the superhuman genetic sequence disappeared after Jesus.
      <p class="anim-appear">The people of the future age discovered the possibility of time travel as a result of all scientific progress. They observed a black hole in space that bends time and space for many years. They named this black hole "Lyria". However, it was not possible to prevent the fact that living beings could not survive exposure to the phenomenon of black holes. For this reason, machines and humanoid robots capable of traveling in time and space were developed.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">The extent to which Lyria bent time and space could only be estimated. Changing events in time would result in a highly philosophical problem with reality. However, the people of the future were willing to risk everything to achieve the concept of the "superhuman." Their entire goal was to send remotely controlled machines and humanoid robots to the time of Jesus and obtain his genetic code.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">The people of the future built all the necessary technological infrastructure, and everything was set in motion. The spaceships containing remotely controlled humanoid robots and machines disappeared into the reality of Lyria. At first, it was believed that the fleet had disappeared due to certain malfunctions. Years later, the first connection was established with the fleet, but the connection was weak and intermittent. The control and communication with the machines became increasingly difficult, and despite efforts, this problem could not be overcome. Therefore, the entire fleet was left under the control of an artificial intelligence developed for this mission.</p>

      <p class="anim-appear">The extent to which Lyria bent reality was still a mystery. Although the fleet's location and route to Earth could be determined, it was impossible to know at what point in time it was bent. Nothing could be fully clarified until the fleet arrived on Earth. And so, the journey began...</p>
